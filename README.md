## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

The app uses logic like:
- Dynamic header detection (for robustness across various Form 3 formats)
- Section-based parsing (`Sold`, `Unsold`, etc.) with keyword boundaries
- Fallbacks if certain fields (like RERA or Date) aren't found in expected locations

---

## 📌 Notes

- Supports typical **Form 3 Excel** formats with `Table A`, `Table B`, etc.
- Built for developers, compliance officers, and real estate finance teams
- Processing runs entirely in-browser via Streamlit
